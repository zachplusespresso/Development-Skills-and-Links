<p>Dear readers, these <b>Java Interview Questions</b> have been designed especially to get you acquainted with the nature of questions you may encounter during your interview for the subject of <b>Java Programming Language</b>. As per my experience, good interviewers hardly planned to ask any particular question during your interview, normally questions start with some basic concept of the subject and later they continue based on further discussion and what you answer &minus;</p>
<section class="toggle">
<label> What do you know about Java?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>Java is a high-level programming language originally developed by Sun Microsystems and released in 1995. Java runs on a variety of platforms, such as Windows, Mac OS, and the various versions of UNIX.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="toggle">
<label> What are the supported platforms by Java Programming Language?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>Java runs on a variety of platforms, such as Windows, Mac OS, and the various versions of UNIX/Linux like HP-Unix, Sun Solaris, Redhat Linux, Ubuntu, CentOS, etc.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="toggle">
<label> List any five features of Java?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>Some features include Object Oriented, Platform Independent, Robust, Interpreted, Multi-threaded</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="toggle">
<label> Why is Java Architectural Neutral?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>It’s compiler generates an architecture-neutral object file format, which makes the compiled code to be executable on many processors, with the presence of Java runtime system.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="toggle">
<label> How Java enabled High Performance?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>Java uses Just-In-Time compiler to enable high performance. Just-In-Time compiler is a program that turns Java bytecode, which is a program that contains instructions that must be interpreted into instructions that can be sent directly to the processor.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="toggle">
<label> Why Java is considered dynamic?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>It is designed to adapt to an evolving environment. Java programs can carry extensive amount of run-time information that can be used to verify and resolve accesses to objects on run-time.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="toggle">
<label> What is Java Virtual Machine and how it is considered in context of Java’s platform independent feature?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>When Java is compiled, it is not compiled into platform specific machine, rather into platform independent byte code. This byte code is distributed over the web and interpreted by virtual Machine (JVM) on whichever platform it is being run.</p> 
</div>
</section>
<section class="toggle">
<label> List two Java IDE’s?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>Netbeans, Eclipse, etc.</p>

<p>Some Java keywords are import, super, finally, etc.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="toggle">
<label> What do you mean by Object?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>Object is a runtime entity and it’s  state is stored in fields and behavior is shown via methods. Methods operate on an object's internal state and serve as the primary mechanism for object-to-object communication.</p> 
</div>
</section>
<section class="toggle">
<label> Define class?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>A class is a blue print from which individual objects are created. A class can contain fields and methods to describe the behavior of an object.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="toggle">
<label> What kind of variables a class can consist of?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>A class consist of Local variable, instance variables and class variables.</p> 
</div>
</section>
<section class="toggle">
<label> What is a Local Variable?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>Variables defined inside methods, constructors or blocks are called local variables. The variable will be declared and initialized within the method and it will be destroyed when the method has completed.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="toggle">
<label> What is a Instance Variable?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>Instance variables are variables within a class but outside any method. These variables are instantiated when the class is loaded.</p> 
</div>
</section>
<section class="toggle">
<label> What is a Class Variable?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>These are variables declared with in a class, outside any method, with the static keyword.</p>
</div>

<div class="toggle-content">
<p>Singleton class control object creation, limiting the number to one but allowing the flexibility to create more objects if the situation changes.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="toggle">
<label> What do you mean by Constructor?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>Constructor gets invoked when a new object is created. Every class has a constructor. If we do not explicitly write a constructor for a class the java compiler builds a default constructor for that class.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="toggle">
<label> List the three steps for creating an Object for a class?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>An Object is first declared, then instantiated and then it is initialized.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="toggle">
<label> What is the default value of byte datatype in Java?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">

</section>
<section class="toggle">
<label> What is the default value of float and double datatype in Java?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>Default value of float and double datatype in different as compared to C/C++. For float its 0.0f and for double it’s 0.0d</p> 
</div>
</section>
<section class="toggle">
<label> When a byte datatype is used?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>This data type is used to save space in large arrays, mainly in place of integers, since a byte is four times smaller than an int.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="toggle">
<label> What is a static variable?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>Class variables also known as static variables are declared with the static keyword in a class, but outside a method, constructor or a block.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="toggle">
<label> What do you mean by Access Modifier?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>Java provides access modifiers to set access levels for classes, variables, methods and constructors. A member has package or default accessibility when no accessibility modifier is specified.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="toggle">
<label> What is protected access modifier?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>Variables, methods and constructors which are declared protected in a superclass can be accessed only by the subclasses in other package or any class within the package of the protected members' class.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="toggle">
<label> What do you mean by synchronized Non Access Modifier?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>Java provides these modifiers for providing functionalities other than Access Modifiers, synchronized used to indicate that a method can be accessed by only one thread at a time.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="toggle">
<label> According to Java Operator precedence, which operator is considered to be with highest precedence?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>Postfix operators i.e () [] . is at the highest precedence.</p> 
</div>
</section>
<section class="toggle">
<label> Variables used in a switch statement can be used with which datatypes?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>Variables used in a switch statement can only be a string, enum, byte, short, int, or char.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="toggle">
<label> When parseInt() method can be used?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>This method is used to get the primitive data type of a certain String.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="toggle">
<label> Why is String class considered immutable?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>The String class is immutable, so that once it is created a String object cannot be changed. Since String is immutable it can safely be shared between many threads ,which is considered very important for multithreaded programming.</p> 
</div>
</section>
<section class="toggle">
<label> Why is StringBuffer called mutable?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>The String class is considered as immutable, so that once it is created a String object cannot be changed. If there is a necessity to make alot of modifications to Strings of characters then StringBuffer should be used.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="toggle">
<label> What is the difference between StringBuffer and StringBuilder class?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>Use StringBuilder whenever possible because it is faster than StringBuffer. But, if thread safety is necessary then use StringBuffer objects.</p> 
</div>
</section>
<section class="toggle">
<label> Which package is used for pattern matching with regular expressions?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>java.util.regex package is used for this purpose.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="toggle">

</div>
</section>
<section class="toggle">
<label> What is finalize() method?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>It is possible to define a method that will be called just before an object's final destruction by the garbage collector. This method is called finalize( ), and it can be used to ensure that an object terminates cleanly.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="toggle">
<label> What is an Exception?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>An exception is a problem that arises during the execution of a program. Exceptions are caught by handlers positioned along the thread's method invocation stack.</p> 
</div>
</section>
<section class="toggle">
<label> What do you mean by Checked Exceptions?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>It is an exception that is typically a user error or a problem that cannot be foreseen by the programmer. For example, if a file is to be opened, but the file cannot be found, an exception occurs. These exceptions cannot simply be ignored at the time of compilation.</p> 
</div>
</section>
<section class="toggle">
<label> Explain Runtime Exceptions?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>It is an exception that occurs that probably could have been avoided by the programmer. As opposed to checked exceptions, runtime exceptions are ignored at the time of compliation.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="toggle">
<label> Which are the two subclasses under Exception class?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>The Exception class has two main subclasses : IOException class and RuntimeException Class.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="toggle">
<label> When throws keyword is used?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>If a method does not handle a checked exception, the method must declare it using the throwskeyword. The throws keyword appears at the end of a method's signature.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="toggle">
<label> When throw keyword is used?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>An exception can be thrown, either a newly instantiated one or an exception that you just caught, by using throw keyword.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="toggle">
<label> How finally used under Exception Handling?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>The finally keyword is used to create a block of code that follows a try block. A finally block of code always executes, whether or not an exception has occurred.</p> 
</div>
</section>
<section class="toggle">
<label> What things should be kept in mind while creating your own exceptions in Java?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>While creating your own exception &minus;</p>
<ul class="list"><li><p>All exceptions must be a child of Throwable.</p></li>

<h2>What is Next?</h2>
<p>Further, you can go through your past assignments you have done with the subject and make sure you are able to speak confidently on them. If you are fresher then interviewer does not expect you will answer very complex questions, rather you have to make your basics concepts very strong.</p>
<p>Second it really doesn't matter much if you could not answer few questions but it matters that whatever you answered, you must have answered with confidence. So just feel confident during your interview. We at tutorialspoint wish you best luck to have a good interviewer and all the very best for your future endeavor. Cheers :-)</p>
